    "1. Lab 1 is an assignment for teams of 2-3 students; the teams are listed on cms. Please make only one submission per team\n",
    "2. The assignment should be completed in a Google Collaboratory notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#). To this end, first create a copy of this notebook in your personal Googel Drive via \"File\" --> \"Save a copy in Drive\". Do not forget to    \n",
    " *    rename the notebook and mention all your teammates in the name;      \n",
    " *    share your notebook within ucu.edu.ua domain, so that we will be able to open and grade it :)  \n",
    "3. Submit the link to the final version of the notebook in the comments field of cms and list all the team members therein. No changes may be made to the notebook after the deadline\n",
    "4. At the top of your notebook, provide a work-breakdown structure estimating efforts of each team member.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "During the past three weeks, you learned a couple of essential notions ant theorems. One of them is Bayes theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of its applications is **Naive Bayes classifier**, which is a probabilistic classifier whose aim is to determine which class some observation probably belongs by using the Bayes formula:\n",
    "$$\\mathsf{P}(\\mathrm{class}\\mid \\mathrm{observation})=\\frac{\\mathsf{P}(\\mathrm{observation}\\mid\\mathrm{class})\\mathsf{P}(\\mathrm{class})}{\\mathsf{P}(\\mathrm{observation})}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the strong independence assumption, one can calculate $\\mathsf{P}(\\mathrm{observation} \\mid \\mathrm{class})$ as\n",
    "$$\\mathsf{P}(\\mathrm{observation}) = \\prod_{i=1}^{n} \\mathsf{P}(\\mathrm{feature}_i),$$\n",
    "where $n$ is the total number of features describing a given observation. Thus, $\\mathsf{P}(\\mathrm{class}|\\mathrm{observation})$ now can be calculated as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathsf{P}(\\mathrm{class} \\mid \\mathrm{\\mathrm{observation}}) = \\mathsf{P}(\\mathrm{class})\\times \\prod_{i=1}^{n}\\frac{\\mathsf{P}(\\mathrm{feature}_i\\mid \\mathrm{class})}{\\mathsf{P}(\\mathrm{feature}_i)}$$\n",

    "\n",

    "* **0 - authors**\n",
    "This data set consists of citations of three famous writers: Edgar Alan Poe, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley and HP Lovecraft. The task with this data set is to classify a piece of text with the author who was more likely to write it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **1 - discrimination**\n",
    "This data set consists of tweets that have discriminatory (sexism or racism) messages or of tweets that are of neutral mood. The task is to determine whether a given tweet has discriminatory mood or does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **2 - fake news**\n",
    "This data set contains data of American news: a headline and an abstract of the article.\n",
    "Each piece of news is classified as fake or credible. The task is to classify the news from test.csv as credible or fake.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **3 - sentiment**\n",
    "All the text messages contained in this data set are labeled with three sentiments: positive, neutral or negative. The task is to classify some text message as the one of positive mood, negative or neutral.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **4 - spam**\n",
    "This last data set contains SMS messages classified as spam or non-spam (ham in the data set). The task is to determine whether a given message is spam or non-spam.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each data set consists of two files: *train.csv* and *test.csv*. The first one you will need find the probabilities distributions for each of the features, while the second one is needed for checking how well your classifier works.\n"
